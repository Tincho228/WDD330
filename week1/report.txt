1 - What did I do since the last meeting?
	This is the first meeting so there is nothing to add.
2 - What am I going to do next?
	I am goin to work on my portfolio. I want to include some bootstrap group-list.
	I always used jquery on my projects. The challenge is to add bootstrap classess with raw javascript.
3 - What are my blockers?
	My blocker is also my passion for detail. I always take large projects instead of keep it simple. 
	I do not want to spend much time in style and just focus on the reading material.
