What did I do since the last meeting?

I have being reading most of the time about methods. Team activity preparation was great.
I tried to understand arrow functions and how to use them. I have quite a challenge to remember everything
about arrays, objects, maps, sets and JSON files. 

What am I going to do next?

This week is my final week to update all of my readings back to normal. At last, I had my Sitepoint premimum access code.
I want to learn more about ES6 syntax declaration and see more tutorial on arrow functions.

What are my blockers?

Callback functions are not easy to understand. I have used NODEJS before but still, it is something I do not understand completely.
I allways use two questions: are how do we call it and how do we use it. That is a common error in me. I should see more about the definition, pros and cons.
