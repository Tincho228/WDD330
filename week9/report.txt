Report Week 9

What did I do since the last meeting?
I have been working on the project proposal number 2. I know this application was ment to be offline. We are using LocalStorage as a data source. But I wanted to add more functionalities to the administrator.
I hope it works out well.
We worked hard with the team assignment. We spent like two hours this time.
I finished the animation reading and saw some tutorial I wanted to use in my application.

What am I going to do next?
Work hard developing my application. 

What are my blockers?
I am not so good on mile tracking and scheduling my proposal.
