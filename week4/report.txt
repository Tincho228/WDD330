Report Week 4

What did I do since the last meeting?
Still reading assignment material. I watched a couple of tutorials of youtube about callback functions.
Maps vs Objects. I find images or diagrams more instructive. I looked after that too. 
I did the event exercises in chapter 7
I watched a couple of tutorials about n-tier applications with javascript. Something like MVC model in php or nodeJS.
Still reading all the chapters even those which are not mentioned in the reading assignment.
Finally contacted Nicolas. 

What am I going to do next?
I would like to read chapter 15, MVC frameworks. I guess that is really important to organize our web applications.
Start working on the app project.
Meeting objectives: Making arrangements for next meeting with Tania and Nicolas.

What are my blockers?
Still trying to understand the n-tier object model that javascript has. Pretty amazing how it goes from one callback function to another.
Organize myself between all the informmation the Reading assignent has vs my curiosity for learning new things on other javascript subjects.
