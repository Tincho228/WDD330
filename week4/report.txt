Report Week 4

What did I do since the last meeting?
Still reading assignment material. I watched a couple of tutorials of youtube about callback functions.
Maps vs Objects. I find images or diagrams more instructive. I looked after that too. 
I did the event exercises in chapter 7
I watched a couple of tutorials about n-tier applications with javascript. Something like MVC model in php or nodeJS.

What am I going to do next?
Work in my first projects of week 4. I took a look at it.


What are my blockers?
