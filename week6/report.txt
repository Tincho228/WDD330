Report Week 5

What did I do since the last meeting?
I inserted a new section in my projects page called troubleshooting. There, I will write all the problems and solutions founded.
Watched some videos about Class Declarations in Javascript because I wanted it to clear some differences with Objects.
MVC object model.
I have been working on the team assignment. Actually we had a couple of problems to understand the solution. I feel more comfortable with the MVC model.

What am I going to do next?
This week I am going to focus on the todo app.  Specially on trello assignments. 

What are my blockers?
Assimilate the Javascript MVC model. I did not want to start the assignment without fixing them.
